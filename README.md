## EDITOR:
### In-Game
Press P while on the menu to open the editor.

The map will be saved to your processing directory (or the .exe directory on the release versions)
then place the map into the game directory and play.
### External
If you are using Processing, you can use the External Version (under osu_clone_editor.pde). This is often at a different release state to the In-Game version, sometimes ahead, sometimes behind. I will try to keep them caught up.
The External Version has a non-scalable window.
