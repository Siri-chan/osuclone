# Contributive Rules
#### Contribution is always appreciated, even though noone knows Processing.
Go ahead and fork the project, or create a new branch, but at least for now, commits to **_siri-chan/osu-clone/master_** I would like to be moderated, and only committed/merged by me or my friend @EpicGamerMaster

Thank You for at least considering Contributing to **osu!clone**







_P.S.: Processing is just BTEC Java so if you know Java just try simplifying a command and it might just work._
